##  Contents

- **Thermal Images**:  
  Time-series thermograms captured during high-temperature oxidation of AISI 1045 steel using an Optris PI 1M infrared camera.

- **Micrometer Data**:  
  Thickness measurements acquired using a micrometer, reflecting total changes throughout the experiments.

- **Folder Structure**:
  - `Thermograms/`: Contains zipped folders for each experiment with thermal images in CSV.
  - `Micrometer/`: Contains xlsx files with thickness measurements that match thermal image timestamps.
 
Across all experiments, a total of 3386 synchronized thermal frames and thickness measurements were collected.

##  Methodology

Steel specimens were subjected to Joule-heating experiments under controlled conditions. Thermal images were recorded. Micrometer readings were taken periodically during heating and cooling stages.  
The goal was to train machine learning regressors capable of estimating specimen thickness variations purely from thermal imaging data.
Each experiment yielded approximately 700 paired measurements of temperature fields and corresponding specimen thickness values. This dense temporal sampling enabled precise tracking of thickness evolution throughout the oxidation process.

## Purpose

This dataset supports the advancement of non-invasive monitoring methods in metallurgy, high-temperature material characterization, and industrial quality control using infrared thermography combined with machine learning.
