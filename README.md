# Thickness_Estimation_Dataset
This repository contains thermographic and micrometric data from high-temperature oxidation experiments on AISI 1045 steel. The dataset captures total thickness variation—due to thermal expansion, oxide growth, and deformation—used for non-contact regression modeling with infrared imagery.
